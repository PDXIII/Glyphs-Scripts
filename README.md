You can clone this repository into your GlyphsApp Script folder located under `~/Library/Application Support/Glyphs/Scripts/` and have fun!

For more scripts take a look at [schriftgestalt](https://github.com/schriftgestalt/Glyphs-Scripts) and [mekkablue](https://github.com/mekkablue/Glyphs-Scripts).

##ExportMetrics.py

This script writes the basic metrics of the current font provided by the font preference panel (cmd + i) into an JSON file under `~/Desktop/FontMetrics/*fontname*-Metrics.json` .

##Sketch.py

This is just a Sketch for experimenting. **It's hardly recommanded not to use this script.** If there is something useful in it you will find it in another script with a discription.
